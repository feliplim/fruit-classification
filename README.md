# Deploy a model in the cloud

**Data source**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moltean/fruits

**Context**:

We are Data Scientist within the very young AgriTech start-up, called "Fruits!", which seeks to offer innovative solutions for fruit harvesting. The company's desire is to preserve fruit biodiversity by allowing specific treatments for each species of fruit by developing intelligent picking robots. "Fruits!" initially wishes to make itself known by making available to the general public a mobile application which would allow users to take a photo of a fruit and obtain information about this fruit. For the start-up, this application would raise awareness among the general public about fruit biodiversity and set up a first version of the fruit image classification engine.

In addition, the development of the mobile application will make it possible to build a first version of the necessary Big Data architecture.

**Our mission** :

Establish the Big Data architecture necessary for scaling up in terms of data volume.
From a dataset consisting of images of fruits and associated labels, appropriate the image processing chain and complete it with a dimension reduction step.
Description of folders and files:

**Notebook**: including the steps of the image processing chain.
Presentation support, including:
Reminder of the problem and presentation of the dataset.
Presentation of the process of creating the Big Data environment, role of the different bricks.
Presentation of the different stages of the image processing chain in PySpark.
